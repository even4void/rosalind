# Solutions to Rosalind problems

Solutions to the [Rosalind project](http://rosalind.info) are mostly written in Python 3. There's a print statement at the end of each script so that it should be enough to run, e.g., `python3 cons.py` to get the desired output. There's also a shebang line, so feel free to `chmod +x` all the scripts if you like.

There are two directories, which correspond to two sub-tracks on the Rosalind project: `bioinfo` refers to the so-called "Bioinformatics Stronghold" track, while `algo` refers to the "Algorithmic Heights" track. In the latter case, I also provide typed or untyped Racket, and I hope to be able to add C and/or Haskell code in the near future.

Stack Overflow sometimes came to the rescue, and TODOs/FIXMEs will eventually be removed at some point.
