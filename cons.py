# Problem 10
# A consensus string c is a string of length n formed from our collection
# by taking the most common symbol at each position; the j th symbol of c
# therefore corresponds to the symbol having the maximum value in the j-th
# column of the profile matrix. Of course, there may be more than one most
# common symbol, leading to multiple possible consensus strings.
# Given: A collection of at most 10 DNA strings of equal length (at most 1
# kbp) in FASTA format.
# Return: A consensus string and profile matrix for the collection. (If
# several possible consensus strings exist, then you may return any one of
# them.)
